Mike encounters Dracky!!!

Now that Mike has recovered from his previously toasty circumstances he’s ready to take on some chumps and build up that sweet bag-o-tricks, so he can finally take a solid swipe at the toast master himself, Dragon. 

During this period he built, Bullet Creep, allowing him to bullet blast his way through foe and challenge alike. With this he will start to forge a path back to crispy castle. 

With the momentum and experience he builds by taking on these smaller challengers he’ll be on a whole other level by the time he reaches Dragon, transformed from a bearded toastable to a bullet blurring dynamo!!

Fear Michael Dracky!!! Be afraid as to you gaze into Bullet Creep’s soulless eyes and meet your maker!!!!  >:D
