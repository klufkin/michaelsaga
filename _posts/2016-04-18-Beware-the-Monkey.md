Monkey’s can be pretty cool, climbing trees, eating bananas, hanging out in barrels, but we all know that deep inside they are devious sycophants, eager to draw our attention away from serious quest making!

Many a talented and gifted adventurer have lost there way lolly gagging around in monkey land. To think… all the great things that could have been accomplished, and all we are left with are bad banana jokes… It brings a tear to the eye.

Michael is well versed in the monkeys’ ways, but will such knowledge be enough?

Every great explorer that exists today has made his or her way through the monkey temple of instant gratification. 

Will he be one of the few who comes out the other side banana peel free?!?
