After a nice EXP boost flattening the Drackster Michael is finally getting into his step. Beginning to get a handle on his new found MegaMan-esque blasting skills he’s ready to put them to work and take back some lost ground!

Healer’s vacant gaze is one that can be found on the face of many an absorbed gamer, so drawn in to realms of fantastic flights that they are unaware of the gelatinous slime like state to which their bodies are reverting back to. But Mike isn’t going to be having any more of those shenanigans! Starting with a hot power blast to Healer’s face!

Time to go save a few slimes from themselves. It’s Slime Time ;D
