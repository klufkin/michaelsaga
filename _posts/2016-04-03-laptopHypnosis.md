Michael has been hypnotized by a floating screen apparition!

A dangerous beast indeed, it draws its victims in with flickers of moving images and interesting web stuff. Once close enough, it ensnares them with a usb controller, sucking on their attention span and placing their victims in a powerful state of hypnosis.

Few warriors have the strength to fight such a powerful creature. How will Michael overcome??
