A wild Dragon appears!!

Dragon back in DWM (Dragon Warrior Monsters) was no rollover when you first meet the guy in the second dungeon, but after playing the game for a while challenges like Dragon become little promenades on the cake walk. 

Starting out at anything is never easy, and you can’t expect to always beat the baddies on your first try, but over time with consistent effort these initial challenges get rolled flat with all the momentum and experience one builds up. 

So Let’s keep at it and break this guy down!!!

Public health announcement: “Don’t pet the dragon”.
