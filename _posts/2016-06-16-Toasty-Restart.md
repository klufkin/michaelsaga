Burnt toast.

Eager to get to the crunchy toasty sweet spot you punch the bread into the toaster again without even taking a bite, and then *poof* burnt toast. Too eager, and now too toasty. It’s easy when you get burnt crispy to just unravel into a motley heap of ash, hard not to when you’re not fire-proof! But any good adventurer knows you just got to take another slice at the bread of persistence.

It was a valiant effort trying to leap ahead and take on Dragon, but Mike’s “party” of skills hadn’t yet scrapped together the adequate experience. As much as we all desire getting to level 9000 there are no short cut’s to awesomeness, and sometimes we just got to accept that us noobs got to tackle the low hanging fruit first. Healy may not be the peak of crowning achievement, but he(she?) sure is a lot better than being left with an inedible piece of toast!

Nothing wrong with a toasty restart. ;)
