Kapow!!!

MegaMike is on a roll! Poor healer didn’t stand a chance against this new and improved Michael. With all of this momentum that he’s been gathering he’s starting to put together a real ground work of skills. Taking on Dragon again is now starting to seem like a real possibility.

It takes a lot of guts to come back swinging after being burnt crispy. Unfortunately when things don’t go as planned it has a tendency to take the spirit out of even some of the most gifted of adventurers. It takes real character to pick up the pieces again, and often when we do so, we find our selves stronger than ever. Did I say Character?? My goodness our young hero seems to be really turning into something… 

I guess we’ll just have to keeping tuning back in and see where things go!
