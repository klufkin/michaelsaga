We all have our personal struggles, and each wears it’s own mask. Some disguise themselves as our friends, as what makes us feel good, pulling us away from what is truly valuable in our short lives. We like to think the monkey is under control, but sometimes we are the one’s that are under its spell. 

They may be bigger than us, and it may seem foolish to disregard them, but it is only through persistence, determination, and struggle that we can find the hero that lives inside of us.
