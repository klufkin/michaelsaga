Our young adventurer has finally made it back to castle one. 

It’s time to do the dance with Dragon again and put all of that hard earned experience points to work! Mike may have been a little green under the gills when he first threw down with dragon poké style, but it looks like Mr. D is sporting the green gills now. 

This definitely will not be an easy fight by any means. Trying to seal the deal on any heroic project is no small task. Mike has already experienced the fiery breathe of burnout before at the hands of Dragon, he doesn’t plan on going through that again.

It’s time to throw down a tango of slice and dice and mount a new trophy to the wall. If he can cross Dragon off the hit list, who know’s what other hero worthy deeds are within him waiting to be discovered?
