The princess is in another castle!!

Ahh maaaaaaaaan…. you mean I have to play even more?? 

Do you think Mario got discouraged every time he found out he still had further to go to achieve his dream of saving the princess? Probably, but that didn’t stop him from keeping on, taking each challenge one level at a time, dropping those goombas under his crusty boots, and flinging fire balls at mutated sea turtle monstrosities. In fact doing all that hard work was kind of fun.

Let’s go see what’s in next castle. :)
